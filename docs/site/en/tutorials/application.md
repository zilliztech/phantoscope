# What is an application?
An application corresponds to a real business scenario. 

A business scenario may require multiple applications to accommodate its unique data processing processes and data format. 

You can create different fields within an application depending on your actual needs. A field can correspond to either a pipeline or structured data. 

Data of different applications is isolated from each other. 

An application has at least one pipeline. A scoreling function is required if an application has multiple pipeline.s
